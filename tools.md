# Task2.Q1

## The different between  VS code and Pycharm

| Comparisons  | Vs code     | PyCharm    |
| -----------  | ----------- |------------
| performance  |  faster than PyCharm  | good
| size         | 67.5 MB     | 150-176 MB
| Extensions   | since the vs code is a modular ride it can be converted a full featured for any framework-platform-language. | or python developers and it might be to download and setup other ides as IntelliJ for java also Clion for C/C++

## The different between Windoes and Linux

| Comparisons      | windows |   Linux   |

| Users      |  4 type admin, child , guest and standard        | 3 type admin , service user and regular    |
|File Systems    | files are stored in folders like C/D/E         | everything is treated like file also the connected devices like mouse keyboard are also files     |
| Security      | based in single-user which make it unstable like the Linux no community to monitoring it directly        | based on a multi-user architecture which making it more stable than a os also it monitoring by the developers    |
| Source code    | open source it can go for the source code and change it as you want         | only specific people have the access to get the source code       |
| Privacy       | you could been watch by the windows itself and it will offering to sync to the Microsoft One-Drive service.       | you are the only one how own the system also it come with an option of built-in military-grade encryption.  |

| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| payment       | free for all with publicly shared codes        | only for the team of web dev how are collaborate on codes   |
| Documentation   | more organized and have a series of guide cover every platform on it         | it have a search bar in the documentation to listing all the documents      |
| Community      | it’s have a large community of developers        | organizes community events that bring together contributors the open source system    |

## TOOLS THAT I CHOSE AND WHY ?

### 1 GitHub , Why ?

- The first reasone that i chose the github for it because it is one of the most commne paltform for the communtiy of coding and also git hub have many features like:

- Regardless of the type of system you have, simply GitHub works on all known operating systems, whether Windows, Linux or even Mac.

- It also has the advantage that it supports most programming languages of all kinds. Simply, you can start with the language you want to work on through GitHub.

- you can have a private repos and you can control how to see this repo and if anyone try to git this private repo and you don’t give him the permaisson it will give him an web page error 404.

- In terms of documentation, GitHub is the most appropriate solution in the programming process, because through it you create a Redmi file and document everything you did during the process of building the program.

### 2 Vs code, Why?

- it preparing the html file by typing "!" only and it will bring the full file and you just fill wathever you want inside it.

- For supporting errors simply by adding a file call "ESLint" this will help you and spot the errors for you regardless of how you write the code, whether it is clean code or not.

- for me i see the Vs code have a kindly user interface and it's look easy to use and understand also i don't it's hard to work on it.

- in side for the Customization you can easly Customization you'r work space and this is one of the most great features that i see it in the app like i can change the theme as i like or to be more speed in coding i can change the keyworad shortcuts which make the prossec more kinde.

- You can Change Language Mode easy by taype the language you want in the search bar but you need to install it before to change it.

### 3 Mac os/Linux , why ?

- as a mac os user when i want to open the terminal it will aoutmaticly change for the linux dircotry.

- linux is free and it is an open source for everyone.

- it have the basic for everything and have a great user interface who anyone can work on it and use it regardless if you are a professional programmer or even student.

- Linux have a light size to install it and more speed than the other OS system.

- Linux have a great support most of the programming languages like the C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby.

## Software Development Methodology

- What is Software Development Methodology ?

- software development methodolgy is a process of a group of processes that is use in software development.

## what i use and why ?

i use the Agile Methodology and why because the tasks can broken in to short sprints that takes about 1 - 4 weeks to complete it and by this Methodology i can have a feedback from the customers and i do the change to it. 

## the Avdantegs for this methodology

- The project has a few errors bucause it split into division of tasks and getting a review of every step we take in the project.

- Due to frequent and transparent development, there is clarity between team members during development.

- Changes in project specifications are easily addressed and implemented with minimal disruption to the timeframe.

## the Disavdantegs for this methodology

- It is possible that this method may cause a loss of concentration in the members due to the frequent demand for changes.

- for the part of documentation in this method it take a long time to git done.

- it fouce in the feedback and the discussions which it will take a too time  for the team.
