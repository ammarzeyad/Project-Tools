| performance  |  faster than PyCharm  | good
| size         | 67.5 MB     | 150-176 MB
| Extensions   | since the vs code is a modular ride it can be converted a full featured for any framework-platform-language. | or python developers and it might be to download and setup other ides as IntelliJ for java also Clion for C/C++

## TOOLS THAT I CHOSE AND WHY ?

### 1 GitHub , Why ?

- The first reasone that i chose the github for it because it is one of the most commne paltform for the communtiy of coding and also git hub have many features like:

- Regardless of the type of system you have, simply GitHub works on all known operating systems, whether Windows, Linux or even Mac.

- It also has the advantage that it supports most programming languages of all kinds. Simply, you can start with the language you want to work on through GitHub.

- you can have a private repos and you can control how to see this repo and if anyone try to git this private repo and you don’t give him the permaisson it will give him an web page error 404.

- In terms of documentation, GitHub is the most appropriate solution in the programming process, because through it you create a Redmi file and document everything you did during the process of building the program.

### 2 Vs code, Why?

- it preparing the html file by typing "!" only and it will bring the full file and you just fill wathever you want inside it.

- For supporting errors simply by adding a file call "ESLint" this will help you and spot the errors for you regardless of how you write the code, whether it is clean code or not.

- for me i see the Vs code have a kindly user interface and it's look easy to use and understand also i don't it's hard to work on it.

- in side for the Customization you can easly Customization you'r work space and this is one of the most great features that i see it in the app like i can change the theme as i like or to be more speed in coding i can change the keyworad shortcuts which make the prossec more kinde.

- You can Change Language Mode easy by taype the language you want in the search bar but you need to install it before to change it.

### 3 Mac os/Linux , why ?

- as a mac os user when i want to open the terminal it will aoutmaticly change for the linux dircotry.

- linux is free and it is an open source for everyone.

- it have the basic for everything and have a great user interface who anyone can work on it and use it regardless if you are a professional programmer or even student.

- Linux have a light size to install it and more speed than the other OS system.

- Linux have a great support most of the programming languages like the C, C++, CSS, Java, JavaScript, HTML, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby.
