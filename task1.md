# Task 1

## Task 1.1

- The main business-related problem is that in Jordan we donâ€™t have various web pages for online food ordering. So, we have created a web page that combines different kind of restaurants in one web page so the online food ordering process is much easier for the user.

## User & System Requirements

1. The home page of the site contains many features, for example, a presentation of food pictures has been created on the page, and you can also log in to the site and create a special request for you, and a box has been created inside the page containing all the restaurants that we have and you can choose Among them, with ease and clarity.

2. When the user click on the cover of the restaurant that he chosen, the site will transfer him to a new tab that contains the restaurant alone with the dishes it offers in addition to the prices.

3. Each restaurant on the site has features that differ from the rest of the restaurants, for example, the color of the cover for each restaurant and a list containing the food.

4. The user can check his shopping cart by clicking on the picture of the shopping cart, and he can also add or remove the product from the list as he wants.

5. The user can see the bill details and he can also see the price of the meal before adding it to his shopping cart.

## Task1.2

- The risks we face in the process while creating the project:

1 ) Time managmenet and task dividing:

- At the beginning, we had an unclear vision for the project, or in other words incomplete in terms of all the features and additions that could be added and implemented within the project. We divided the project into tasks and distributed them to all team members and through this process the vision was reached which we look forward to.

2 ) Bad team communication:

- One of the most important reasons for the failure of the team, even if it includes the best members, is the difficulty of members communicating with each other, and frankly, we faced this problem, which is considered to me one of the most difficult risks. The difference is greatly, but the problem was solved by listening to everyone, understanding the opinions presented, and choosing the best, which is in the interest of the team and its distinction.

3 ) Learn new things:

- This is also considered one of the risks that were exposed during the project and were successfully faced. We have knowledge in web development, but at the same time it is not enough knowledge that qualifies us to create a website from scratch. During this process, we learned new skills based on some well-known sources such as Google. and Stackover Flow.

4 ) Website is unstable:

- A site crashed many times when we were in the process of developing the code, but with the presence of many sources, the problem was searched for the first time we encountered and the solution was found, but it was not that easy, and with the repetition of the matter and the site crash, it is solved faster than the time before.

## Task 1.3

- List of requirements:

1. The system must have a home page that contains all restaurants in a slide show for each food category.

2. The system must contain a href to go to the restaurants page to order.

3. The system must contain a full menu in the restaurants page.

4. The system must contain all the orders in the shopping cart and the user can cancel the order or place the order.

5. The system must have a page to display the number of items the user has chosen.

6. The system must have a page to display all invoice details.

## Database Design & the Wireframe

*- We use a method call "LocalStorage Function":*

*- The definition for it:*

*Web applications can store data locally in the user's browser with no expiry using localStorage. When the browser is closed, the data is not destroyed, and it will be available when the browser is opened again.*

*Who We use it ?*

**we write a constructor that takes the name of the meal from the resturant and also take the price for it after that it do a push for an array then save it to our LocalStorge by that way we save our data for the user that put it inside our website.*

## Home Page & Wireframe

As we see here is the wireframe for our homepage

![Home Page](/img/home.PNG)

then we have another wireframe also for the resturant that we have it

![Resturant](/img/resturant.PNG)

the last that we have is the Activity Diagram

## Our Coding &Implementation Technique

Agile: this Technique is a kinde of project management process it uesd by the software eng to the software development where self-organizing and cross-functional teams, as well as their clients, collaborate to develop requests and solutions.

Scrum : is an agile project management framework that used by the teams of dev to develop or deliver and sustain complex products and it is continuosly shipping value to customers by the framework for getting the work done also it give the team the flexibilty to adapt and change and help overcome many of the recurring problems

## Features of Scrum are

1. Scrum is Better Visibility Users/clients are actively involved throughout the product development process, according to development methodology. As a result, key stakeholders involved in the project will have more visibility, ensuring that everyone's expectations are met.

2. Scrum is Uncommone Quality Adaptability is a major attribute in Agile and Scrum, as opposed to the traditional approach, which has little flexibility and only a limited capacity for adopting any modifications to the existing model. The technique ensures that all changes are supported and integrated into the existing project, resulting in high-quality results. Agile and Scrum adoption can produce considerable improvements in product quality within the schedule and budget constraints.

3. Scrum is not an heavy-weigthed System.

4. Scrum is High Transparency and This is one of the most important elements of the Agile and Scrum methodologies. It enables many stakeholders to contribute and be fully involved in the project throughout. This level of transparency is available at every stage of the project cycle, including planning, reviews, and feature prioritization.

## Black Box Testing

- The Defintion for BlackBox Testing is a  functionality of software programs are tested without knowledge of the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal routes in software testing. Black Box Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the input and output of software applications and is totally driven by software requirements and specifications. Behavioral testing is another name for it.
